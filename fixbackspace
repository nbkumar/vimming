often, on new linux terminals , on vim editors, backpace wont work. to fix 
>>stty erase '^?'

other solution using set did not work. ( should have been)
in .vimrc file
set nocompatible
set backspace=indent,eol,start
set backspace=2

how to locate .vimrc?
>>echo %HOME
if not existing in $HOME, create one

How to ensure same vimrc is being used?
 in the .vimrc, set number. you should see lines numbered in any new vim file
